    title: "Authentication",
    description: "Our authentication system is designed to ensure the highest level of security and user convenience. It includes robust signup and login functionalities, using encrypted password handling with technologies like bcrypt and secure token-based session management through JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This ensures that all user data remains protected at all times. Users can register and log in seamlessly, and once authenticated, they gain access to key features such as vehicle booking, ride history, and payment options. We also implement refresh token mechanisms to maintain long-term sessions without compromising on security. Our system prevents unauthorized access, supports role-based access control (admin vs user), and ensures that all user actions are securely validated and logged. Whether you're a rider booking a trip or an admin managing the platform, our authentication system provides a reliable gateway for a safe and personalized experience.",
